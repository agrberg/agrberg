# Aaron Rosenberg — Software Craftsman

I'm Aaron and the goal of this README is to share with you how I think about work, process, and how my [values](values.md) guide me. GitHub is a natural place to maintain this as, in addition to [Markdown processing](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), it is designed around continual improvement and facilitating growth.

**My department is Engineering, my job is to solve problems.** Engineers take pride in the code they develop and the value it delivers. It is immensely satisfying to not only [learn in depth and precisely tune how vital systems function](https://medium.com/gusto-engineering/secure-and-customize-rails-logs-with-ease-ae5fe7f795a3) but see them lead to 20+% performance improvements. Like other creative fields, there are different types of craftsmanship suited for various tasks. As code is read more than it is written, it is important to [emphasize readability and maintainability](https://medium.com/gusto-engineering/false-fences-make-bad-neighbors-26b007ced507) to solve today's problems and maximize flexibility for speculative tomorrows.

**Communication is key.** I love wordplay and eye roll inducing puns. Just as careful word choice is crucial for the joke's success, a concise and thorough understanding of [who, what, where, when, why, and how](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Ws) are necessary for a team's and product's success.

**Do one thing well at a time.** The valuable guidance of the [single responsibility principle (SRP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle) can be applied to many challenges. Breaking complicated problems into smaller singular pieces makes solving each one easier. When each is solved well, the whole is incomparably greater than the sum of its parts.

**Details both matter and must be tailored.** High attention to detail has vastly improved the quality and efficiency of my work while reducing risk and expanding solution discovery. However, the obverse of this coin is providing the best most concise details to a given audience. My engineering teammates are interested in the nuances of how the test suite works, the business cares that our code is tested thoroughly and we catch and fix regressions before they get to the customer.

**Continuous Purposeful Disciplined Learning** - I enjoy following technology trends through industry publications, conferences, and primarily hands on experimentation. However, I'm disciplined about adoption. For production systems, I believe in choosing ["boring technology"](https://boringtechnology.club/) that solves real problems rather than chasing novelty. New tools earn their place in my toolkit only when they uniquely address business challenges that existing solutions cannot handle effectively. This approach has helped avoid costly rework from the "solution in search of a problem" trap while ensuring I'm prepared when the right use case emerges.
