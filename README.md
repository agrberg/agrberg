# Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm Aaron and I'm looking forward to working with you. This document's purpose is to lay out how I work. My intention in sharing this is to provide clarity into my process and present the standard I hold myself to. Storing this on GitHub provides more than [Markdown processing](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), it also makes it easy to continually improve the document and myself.

**My department is Engineering, my job is to solve problems.** Engineers hold a great deal of pride over the code and how it solves the business' problems. When I write and evaluate code, I strive for concise, maintainable code with an emphasis on clarity over cleverness. I use the same techniques to solve usability, discoverability, and development process problems.

**Communication is key.** I love wordplay (and hope to make you roll your eyes at a pun). Underlying this is my belief that, just as careful word choice is crucial for a joke's success, explicit information and expectations lead to reliability and understanding. I will ask better and better questions until I understand, and I welcome the same.

**I believe in doing one thing well.** I break complicated problems into smaller and smaller pieces until each represent "one thing." When each is done well, the whole becomes incomparably greater than the sum of its parts. I use the [single responsibility principle (SRP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle) as a guide not only for code but discussions and interpersonal issues.

**I care about the details.** Different people find different details important or elusive. I have particular trouble with my go-to example of catching spelling errors. However, I enjoyed checking a dictionary to ensure "go-to" is the written form of the adjective and not the transitive verb, "go to."
