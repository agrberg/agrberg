# Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm Aaron and I look forward to working with you. This document shares how I think about work and process and presents the goals I holdÂ for myself. GitHub is a natural place to maintain this as,Â in addition to [Markdown processing](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), it is designed around continual improvement and facilitating growth.

**My department is Engineering, my job is to solve problems.** Engineers take pride in the code they develop and and the value it delivers. As in other creative expressive fields, there are different types of craftsmanship suited for various tasks. Code is read more than it is written so my craftsmanship emphasizes readability and maintainability to solve today's problems and maximize flexibility for speculative tomorrows.

**Communication is key.** I love wordplay and eyeÂ roll inducing puns. Just as careful word choice is crucial for the joke's success, a concise and thorough understanding of [who, what, where, when, why, and how](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Ws) are necessary for a team's and product's success.

**Do one thing well at a time.** The [single responsibility principle (SRP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle) is not only a valuable guide for software development, but for many challenges. Breaking complicated problems into smaller singular pieces makes solving each one easier. When each is solved well, the whole is incomparably greater than the sum of its parts.

**Details both matter and must be tailored.** High attention to detail has vastly improved the quality and efficiency of my work while reducing risk and expanding solution discovery. However, the obverse of this coin is providing the best most concise details to a given audience. My engineering teammates are interested in the nuances of how the test suite works, the business cares that our code is tested thoroughly and we catch and fix regressions before they get to the customer.
