# Hello :wave:

I'm Aaron and I'm looking forward to working with you. This document's purpose is to layout my values and how I work. My intention in sharing this is to provide clarity into my process and present the standard I hold myself to. Storing this on GitHub provides more than [Markdown processing](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), it also makes it easy to continually improve the document and myself.

**My department is Engineering, my job is to solve problems.** Engineers will always hold a great deal of responsibility and pride over the code and how it solves the business' problems. When I write or evaluate code, I strive for concise maintainable code with an emphasis on clarity over cleverness. I use the same techniques to solve usability, discoverability, and development process problems.

**Communication is key.** I love wordplay and hope to make you roll your eyes at a pun. However, in all productivity focused conversations I believe reliability and understanding come from explicit information. I will ask better and better questions until I understand and welcome the same from all collaborators.

**I believe in doing one thing well.** I break complicated ideas up into smaller and smaller pieces until each are represent "one thing." If each is done well, the whole becomes incomparably greater than the sum of its parts. I use the [single responsibility principle (SRP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle) as a guide.

**I care about the details.** Different people find different details important or evasive. I have particular trouble with the go-to example of checking for spelling errors. However, I enjoyed checking a dictionary to ensure "go-to" is the written form of the adjective and not the transitive verb, "go to."
