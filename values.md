# Values

## Authenticity
> representing one's true nature or beliefs

I want there to be no ambiguity to who I am. I have strong beliefs, loosely held.

## Boldness
> willing to take risks, innovate. Courageous, confident, and daring but not blind or reckless

Be the change you wish to see in the world. Work together with people who believe in the same cause and you can accomplish wonderful things.

## Honesty
> free of deceit and untruthfulness

Honesty enables trust and builds true, long-term kindness. It's okay to disagree with the truth, but you should be provided the whole truth.

## Learning
> acquisition of knowledge through work

Investing in yourself is the most effective way to improve. Learning is never over and even traditional wisdom can be improved.
